## Technologies
The following technologies were used:

- `HTML`
- `CSS`
- `JavaScript`
- `Digitraffic REST API`

## Setup

- Open the `index.html` file in your web browser
- No installations or backend server needed

## Approach
- I used the `fetch()` function to make REST API calls to `https://rata.digitraffic.fi`.
- The station list is loaded and added to dropdowns.
- Train data is filtered and sorted by departure time.
- DOM manipulation is done entirely in JS.
- User's last searched route is stored using `localStorage`.

## Status
**Junien Aikatauluhaku** is complete and fully functional.

### Future ideas for development:
- ‚è±Ô∏è Live update interval
- üåç Multi-language support
